  ### Development application on Native Android, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose as well. In this app the primary thing was GRAPHQL -that is sort of a mix of local database and restapi, but way more fast, cause we actually can schedule what data we want to used based in the API, so we can manager the package to get only the informations that we want.
